I'd like to visualize the correlation between absentee rate and student performance at schools in the West Contra Costa Unified School District. Attendence is a noted problem among schools in the district; on average, district students miss 6 percent of their classes anually, which adds up to losing more than a full year of acedemic instruction over 12 years.

I'd like to learn how the data is split geographically and per school. (School location is an important factor to consider in attendance rate, which is something I'd like to try and work out with data.)

I'll use the California Department of Education for data on absenteeism and student performance. I haven't yet figured out which measures to use for student performance, though it will be interesting to explore the pros and cons of different measures.

I'm considering a map graph for locational purposes. A histogram, for clearer conveyance of data, should also work.I'd like to visualize the correlation between absentee rate and student performance at schools in the West Contra Costa Unified School District.
